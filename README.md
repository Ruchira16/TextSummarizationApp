# Text Summarization App

## Introduction
Creating a summary from a given piece of content is a very abstract process that everyone participates in. Automating such a process can help parse through a lot of data and help humans better use their time to make crucial decisions. With the sheer volume of media out there, one can be very efficient by reducing the fluff around the most critical information. Automatic Text Summarization, thus, is an exciting yet challenging frontier in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).Text Summarization is broadly divided into two types that is Extractive text Summarization and Abstractive Text Summarization. In this project, we have used Extractive Text Summarization.
